## Overview

BM2Excel provides an intuitive GUI that allows users to:

1. **Select an HTML file** containing bookmarks.
2. **Choose specific folders** for processing via an interactive dialog.
3. **Extract and organize** bookmark information such as titles, URLs, folder paths, and dates.
4. **Export the data** to an Excel workbook using xlsxwriter, complete with custom formatting.

This tool aims to simplify the process of managing, sharing, and analyzing bookmark collections.

## Features

- **HTML Bookmark Extraction:** Recursively parses HTML to extract bookmarks and folder information.
- **Folder Organization:** Splits folder paths into separate columns (levels), making it easier to view and sort your data.
- **GUI-based Folder Selection:** Allows users to select which folders to process.
- **Excel Export:** Generates a neatly formatted Excel workbook with appropriate styling for URLs and dates.
- **Customizable:** Option to include the input file name as a column in the output.
